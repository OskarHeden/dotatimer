	<h2>DotaTimer</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to the magical realm of Dotatimer, your trusty sidekick for tracking Dota 2 objectives.
	</p>
	<p>
		Have you ever found yourself yearning for a sixth sense to predict Roshan's respawn? Or wished
		for a crystal ball to foresee the appearance of Power Runes, Wisdom Runes, or Bounty Runes?
		Well, your prayers to GabeN have been answered!
	</p>
	<p>
		Dotatimer is here, a creation forged in the fiery crucible of caffeine-fueled coding marathons
		and relentless debugging battles. It's more than just a timer - it's your strategic companion in
		this grand theater of endless battle. Our mission is simple: to let you focus on epic jukes and
		Godlike sprees, while we handle the mundane reality of keeping a close eye on every objective.
	</p>
	<h2>The Curators</h2>
	<p>
		We are a party of two, armed with the double-edged sword of gaming passion and tech wizardry.
		Like two halves of a Heart of Tarrasque, we've fused our love for Dota 2 and our knack for
		creating awesome tech to forge DotaTimer.
	</p>

	<p>
		We believe in the power of community, and we are committed to refining and upgrading Dotatimer
		based on your sage advice. Your feedback is as valuable to us as a well-placed Observer Ward.
	</p>
	<p>
		If Dotatimer assists you in clutch plays and you feel like showering some love, consider "Buying
		us a coffee". Every coin counts in our quest to maintain and improve this game-changing tool,
		and trust us, it's a lot cheaper than buying a Divine Rapier!
	</p>
	<p>
		Give Dotatimer a spin today, and take your Dota 2 experience from ‘feeding’ to 'EZ Game, EZ
		Life'.
